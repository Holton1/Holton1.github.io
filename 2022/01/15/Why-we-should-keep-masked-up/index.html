<script src="/js/util.js"></script>

<script>
    if(isMobile()) {
        loadjscssfile('../../../../css/mobile.css', 'css');

<p>Why we should masked up? New varients come out one by one with decreasing dangerous levels.</p>
<ol>
<li>Flattening the curve can blunt the impact on health-care system, thus lesson the variant’s social toll.</li>
</ol>
<p>We took the lesson when the curve first rises at a peak rate. Now the lesson is still true. “Mask up, Bunker down, flattern the curve!” Even if the peak will arrive sooner or latter, delaying the arrival of the peak as much as possible, can blunt the presure on social health-care system so the overall deaths will be much lower than it otherwise will be.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The new, better treatment is developing, so the longer we stay uninfected, the better treatment we can have.</li>
</ol>
<p>New medicines are under development but now are very limited due to large amount of new cases, so do the vacinnes. But the decline can be sped up by the same behaviours that temper the cases up. If we stay masked up, we can mitigate infection so all of us can get the new treatment faster.</p>
<p>What comes after the peak is NOT out of our control. Avoid seeing “past the peak” as a cue to the relapse of risker behaviours. The steps we made now not only decide how long we stay in peak after the curve rises, but also eventually, where we arrive – as well as how we land after the curve.</p>
