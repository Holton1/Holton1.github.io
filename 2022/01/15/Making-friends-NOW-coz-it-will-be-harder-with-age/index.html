<p>New friendship is harder with an increasing age. Based on the friendship report from Snapchat in 2019, the age people make their best friends is 21. During young adulthood, friendship is easier when people is in the early formative of life experience and has much free time; as age goes up, people’s free time is fulfilled by many things, marriage, children, fully developed career etc. But most importantly, at the midlife where people see the shape of their life, they believe they have all the friends they need. Thus, they close the door of their cab. </p>
<p>Have correct expection befriending with different people. People from southeast Asia and India have an average of 6 closest friends, this number declines to 2 for people from US, UK, western EU and Australia.

So if you are an Asian and try befriending with a western people, find someone that is energetic, progressive for new friendship. Better do it when you have free time (which you won’t always have) and it takes 200 hours and at least several weeks to make a stranger to a close friend. </p>
